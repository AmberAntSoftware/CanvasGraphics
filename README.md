# CanvasGraphics

>> In order to use this small library in a HTML document, add a script tag in the headr BEFORE creating any objects.

Attempt at creating a simpler way to use HTML Canvas's Graphical functions with more code that does not have to be handled by the user.

This project was based on Java's naming conventions of the Graphics class. It was originally part of an experiment to allow of copy and paste of java code into javascript.
